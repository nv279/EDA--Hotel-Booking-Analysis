# EDA--Hotel-Booking-Analysis
INTRODUCTION:
This research analyses the challenges faced by City Hotel and Resort Hotel due to escalating cancellation rates, adversely affecting their revenue streams and room occupancy. By analysing various factors influencing hotel booking cancellations, alongside pertinent data, we aim to propose effective strategies for mitigating cancellations. Furthermore, we explore insights to assist hotels in making informed pricing and promotional decisions. Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to provide actionable insights that equip both hotels with the means to combat the detrimental effects of high cancellation rates and enhance overall revenue generation efficiency. Let's embark on this journey to uncover valuable solutions for these hospitality establishments.
BUSINESS PROBLEM:
In recent times, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have encountered elevated levels of booking cancellations, leading to a series of challenges such as reduced revenues and suboptimal utilisation of hotel rooms. Consequently, the primary objective for both establishments is to minimise cancellation rates, aiming to enhance revenue generation efficiency. This imperative not only drives the hotels' operational strategies but also forms the focal point for the comprehensive business advice we aim to provide. This report centres on the analysis of hotel booking cancellations, alongside the examination of other factors unrelated to their core business operations and annual revenue generation. By focusing on these aspects, we seek to offer thorough insights and recommendations tailored to address this prevalent issue, thereby assisting both City Hotel and Resort Hotel in overcoming the obstacles posed by high cancellation rates and optimizing their revenue-generating capabilities.
ASSUMPTION:
1.	It is not anticipated that any notable events that took place between 2015 and 2017 will have a substantial effect on the data being examined. 

2.	The data that has been supplied is still applicable and can be used to evaluate possible hotel business plans. 

3.	If hotels use the suggested methods, there shouldn't be any unanticipated consequences. 

4.	As of right now, neither hotel has implemented any of the suggested fixes.
5.	The frequency of cancellations of reservations is the main factor affecting the efficiency of revenue generating. 

6.	When a room is cancelled, it remains empty for the whole time it was reserved. 
7.	Most customers make hotel reservations and then cancel them within the same year. 
RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
1. What factors influence the cancellation of hotel reservations?
 2. How can we improve the cancellation of hotel reservations? 
3. In what ways will heels help with decisions about pricing and promotions?




HYPOTHESIS:
1. When prices are higher, there are more cancellations. 
2. Customers tend to cancel more frequently on longer waiting lists. 
3. The bulk of customers make their reservations through offline travel agencies.

ANALYSIS AND VISULISATION:
The bar graph provided illustrates the proportion of reservations that have been canceled and those that remain intact. It is evident that a substantial portion of reservations have not been canceled, indicating a considerable impact on the earnings of the hotels. Approximately 37% of clients have canceled their reservations, further underscoring the significant effect on revenue generation.

 When comparing city hotels to resort hotels, it appears that city hotels experience a higher volume of bookings. This discrepancy in booking volume may suggest that resort accommodations tend to be pricier than those located in urban areas.

 
The line graph shows variations in the average daily prices for resort hotels and city hotels, highlighting situations where the rates for the former are less expensive than the rates for the latter. It is clear that resort hotel rates frequently rise on weekends and holidays.
 


The purpose of the grouped bar graph is to analyse the months with the highest and lowest numbers of reservations according to their status. The graph makes it clear that August has the most confirmed and cancelled reservations overall. On the other hand, January is the month with the most cancelled reservations.




 
This bar graph shows that cancellations occur more frequently when prices are highest and less frequently when they are lowest. Therefore, the only thing that can be held accountable for the cancellation is the cost of the lodging. Let's now examine which nation has the largest number of cancelled reservations. Portugal is the nation with the most cancellations overall.

 
Let's investigate the region from which visitors to the motels are coming and reserving. Does it originate from online or offline travel agents, groups, or direct? Approximately 46% of the customers are from online travel agents, while 27% are from organisations. Just 4% of customers make direct hotel reservations by going there.




 
Reservations are cancelled when the average daily rate is higher than when they are not cancelled, as the graph illustrates. It amply supports the preceding analysis, which states that a higher price corresponds with a larger failure rate.
 

RECOMMENDATION:
1. Higher prices correlate with increased cancellation rates. To mitigate reservation cancellations, hotels could adjust their pricing strategies, potentially lowering rates for specific locations. Additionally, offering discounts to customers may be beneficial.
2. The proportion of cancellations in resort hotels exceeds that of city hotels. To address this, hotels could consider offering discounted room rates during weekends or holidays.
3. Initiating marketing campaigns at the beginning of January, accompanied by reasonable promotions, could bolster revenue, given the higher cancellation rates observed during this month.
4. Enhancing the quality of accommodations and services, particularly in Portugal, may help decrease cancellation rates.
